        <ol>
            <li>Provide your name, major, year in school (sophomore, junior, etc). <br>
                Echo, Com des and CS, sophomore. </li>
            <li> Tell us a bit about your background and what prompted you to take this class.<br>
                I did a few interaction projects on my own during high school that are centered around cargo delivery 
                and health apps, so I want to strengthen my interaction design skills through this class. </li>
            <li>Do you have any experience with HTML/CSS/JS? If so, tell us a bit about it.<br>
                I did a really simple website with HTML/CSS/JS before, and I also tried making it responsive for 
                different screens. </li> 
            <li>Name one thing you hope to learn in this class.<br>
                I hope to have a deeper understanding of interaction design and make some practical projects. </li>
            <li>Name one way you expect designing for screen to be different from designing for paper.<br>
                We need to consider how the user actually interact with the screen, for example, how they swipe, click
                or hover over something. There are a lot more interactions going on with screen compared to paper. </li>
            <li>Provide a link to a website you think exemplifies effective design. Explain your choice.<br>
                https://washu.edu/. I chose the WashU website because I think the design is clean and effective. Users 
                can see each tabs clearly and information are organised in a user-friendly way. </li>
            <li>Provide a link to a website you think exemplifies effective communication. Explain your choice.<br>
                https://www.amazon.com/. I chose the Amazon website because it uses hierarchy and emphasizes promotion or 
                discounted products at the top so it is clear for users to find them. </li>
            <li>Provide a link to a website you think works well. Explain your choice.<br>
                https://www.youtube.com/. Youtube has a clear layout. The vertical tabs on the left allow users to find 
                specific contents like playlists or liked videos effectively. The videos are categorized and tailored to 
                users' preferences. </li>
        </ol>
