            I think I've seen this film before <br>
            And I didn't like the ending<br>
            I'm not your problem anymore<br>
            So, who am I offending now?<br>
            You were my crown<br>
            Now I'm in exile, seeing you out<br>
            I think I've seen this film before<br>
            So, I'm leaving out the side door
        </p> 

        <p class="stanza2">
            So step right out, there is no amount<br>
            Of crying, I can do for you<br>
            All this time<br>
            We always walked a very thin line<br>
            You didn't even hear me out (you didn't even hear me out)<br>
            You never gave a warning sign (I gave so many signs)
        </p>

        <p class="stanza3">
            All this time<br>
            I never learned to read your mind (never learned to read my mind)<br>
            I couldn't turn things around (you never turned things around)<br>
            'Cause you never gave a warning sign (I gave so many signs)<br>
            So many signs, so many signs<br>
            You didn't even see the signs
        </p>

            I think I've seen this film before<br>

            So, what am I defending now?<br>
            You were my town<br>
            Now I'm in exile, seeing you out<br>
            I think I've seen this film before<br>
