    <h4>Instructions</h4>
    <ol>
       <li> To Make the pastry cream Filling: In a sauce pan, combine the milk and 1/3 cup of sugar. Bring to a boil, stirring to dissolve sugar. Remove from heat. In a small bowl, combine 1/3 cup of sugar and 2 tablespoons flour. Beat in the eggs and vanilla.</li>

       <li>Mix 1/2 cup of hot milk into egg mixture, then pour the egg mixture back into the saucepan with the hot milk. Return to heat and bring to a boil. Continue cooking over medium heat until mixture thickens and becomes smooth. Remove from heat and let cool for 1 hour.</li>
        
       <li>Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease and flour a 9 inch springform pan. Combine and sift the flour and baking powder. Set aside</li>
        
       <li>Cream 1 1/8 cup sugar and 3 eggs until light and fluffy. Fold in the sifted flour mixture in three increments, being careful not to overmix.</li>

    <p><a href="https://www.americastestkitchen.com/browse">Americastestkitchen</a> This website is clean and polished, the layout is very clear and users can find their dishes easily. It is user-friendly and easy to navigate around. The font and color choices match the theme of the website and feel professional.</p>
    <p><a href="https://www.blueapron.com/cookbook">Blue apron</a> This website have good use of negative space so it feels very comfortable scrolling through the recipes. The hierarchy of text makes it easy to see the main compoenents of the recipe, such as the title,ingredients and time. The photos make the dishes look appealing. </p>
    <p><a href="https://www.hellofresh.com/recipes">Hellofresh</a> This website is very organised and it groups recipes based on tags like region or type of dish. The typography is very consistent and easy to follow. Even the photos have similar layout and they are all taken in the same angle shot and have round plate.</p>

    <h2>Non-recipe web links</h2>
    <p><a href="https://www.wholefoodsmarket.com/products">Wholefoods</a> I like the way Wholefood incorporate food images into their website. The photos are integrated smoothly with body of text. There are also small details like drop shadow that make the photo stands out. </p>
    <p><a href="https://www.mcdonalds.com/us/en-us/full-menu/burgers.html">Mcdonalds</a> I think the side menu bar is easy to navigate and showcases all the burger options clearly. Even though the color choice is limited, it matches well with the branding through using yellow buttons. They also showcase each ingredients on seperate photos.</p>
